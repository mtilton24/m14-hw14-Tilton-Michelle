This simple webpage was built using Bootstrap, which helped me quickly organize the layout and ensure it works well on both desktops and mobile devices.

Bootstrap Components Used:

Navbar: The navigation bar at the top is responsive, which means it adjusts nicely for smaller screens with a toggle for the menu (hamburger icon).

Cards: I used cards to display sections about "About Me", "Interests", and "Goals". Each card contains an image, a headline, some text, and a button.

Buttons: Each card has a button styled with Bootstrap's primary color. It's set up to potentially lead to more information.

Grid System: I arranged the cards in a grid layout using col-md-4, meaning each card takes up one-third of the space in a row on medium or larger screens.
